- **ScrollTrigger**: This is a GSAP plugin that provides scroll-based animations, such as parallax effects, toggling classes, and more.
- **Text Animations**: This involves animating text content for a more dynamic user experience.
- **Timelines**: GSAP Timelines are used to sequence animations, allowing for precise control over the timing and order of animations.
